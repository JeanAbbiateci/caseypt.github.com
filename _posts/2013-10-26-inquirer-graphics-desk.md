For the past few weeks I've been working at the Graphics Desk of The Philadelphia Inquirer. My focus there has been on creating maps and graphics for print.

[John Duchneskie](https://twitter.com/jduchneskie), the graphics editor, is incredibly talented and has been a great teacher. Getting to work with and learn from John has filled in a lot of gaps in my design skill set. His guidance and teachings on the fundamentals of news design, typography and information density have been invaluable.

A lot of my assignments have been to create basic maps, but it's been fun and challenging to create them within the constraints of printâ€“limited space and, largely, no color.

This past week, John and I built a map to accompany coverage of the one year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. The goal was to create a map that showed damage caused by Sandy, as well as some of the relief money that has been coming in. Here's what we came up with:

There's a simple [online version](http://www.inquirer.com/exclusive/data/229297321.html?authenticate=y) (paywall), but our focus was on print. Here's a [high res version](http://media.philly.com/images/nj_damage_sandy.jpg) from Illustrator. The map was created in ArcMap, but I got to use my NICAR13 [R training](https://gist.github.com/ashaw/94072018b242cf0605dd) to create a few exploratory maps, and [Tabula](http://jazzido.github.io/tabula/) to extract data from a [NJ report](http://www.state.nj.us/dca/announcements/pdf/CDBG-DisasterRecoveryActionPlan.pdf) on Sandy aid.

Below are a few other graphics I've put together. I'm looking forward to learning some more over the next couple weeks.
