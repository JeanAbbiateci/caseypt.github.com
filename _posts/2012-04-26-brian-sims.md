title: Campaign Contributions to Brian Sims

Following his win in the Democratic primary for Pennslyvania's 182nd legislative district, Brian Sims is set to become the state's first openly gay legislator. Dave Davies makes note in his primary night [wrap-up](http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/off-mic/item/37489-brian-sims-breaks-the-mold-unseats-long-term-incumbent) that Sims was able to unseat 14 term Rep. Babette Josephs in part because of the national support his campaign received. I took a look at the campaign finance reports available for Sims4PAPac, the political action committee that supported Sims' bid. About one-third of the contributions to Sims4PAPac were collected from out-of-state donors. 

Sims received 180 out-of-state contributions, totaling $50,665. The most notable amount of out-of-state contributions come from Washington, D.C, which total $23,675. Pennsylvania residents donated $98,999 to Sims. In comparison, the Committee to Elect Babette Josephs received seven out-of-state contributions, totaling $5,750. Josephs' PAC raised $26,625 in total for this election, compared to Sims' $149,664.
