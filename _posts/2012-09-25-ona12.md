Thanks to the [Center for Public Interest Journalism](http://www.cpijournalism.org/), I attended the [Online News Association conference](http://ona12.journalists.org/) in San Francisco this past week. I was there on behalf of the [Philadelphia Public Interest Information Network](http://www.ppiin.org), where I work as an application developer and help journalist acquire, process, and visualize data. Being new to the field of journalism, as well as this being my first professional conference, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It turned out to be a really immersive and inspiring experience, with lots of networking, that was a little short on the data-journalism side of things.

####Sessions

I was pretty pleased with the variety of sessions that were offered. Not all of them were relevant to me, but I was able to find a good session to attend for each time slot.

There were many good lessons to be learned in [The Business of Collaboration](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/the-business-of-collaboration/) for PPIIN; which aims to collaborate with local news organizations. The most important takeaway for me was from [Stephen Engelberg](https://twitter.com/SteveEngelberg), the managing editor of [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org). He said to make sure to work out the small details and logistics of any collaboration first. This includes things like bylines, publication date, logos, etc. Once those things are taken care of, there will be less of a chance of something coming up that delays or kills the project. Engelberg mentioned that after about 150 collaborations, there are some organizations (none were named) that they may not partner with again, but not a single collaboration has been canceled.

In the [Collect, Clean and Manipulate: A Data Journalism Workshop](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/collect-clean-and-manipulate-a-data-journalism-workshop/) session, though not really a workshop, [Jennifer LaFleur](https://twitter.com/j_la28), Director of Computer-Assisted Reporting at ProPublica, went over good tips and techniques for requesting data from public agencies. I asked if she would ever consider providing an agency data administrator an extraction script or walking them step-by-step through a data export process. She basically said no and has done just about everything to collect data from government; which is what I was hoping to hear.

At the [Designing Digital Newsrooms](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/designing-digital-newsrooms/) session
[Steve Herrmann](https://twitter.com/BBCSteveH), Editor of BBC News Online, gave a good overview of how the BBC combined all its various newsrooms (TV, radio, online) into one collaborative newsroom contained in the same space. This change allowed them to create a much more consistent news experience for all of their audiences.

One of the last presentations I saw was [David Wright](https://twitter.com/dwjr)'s [Design Is How It Works](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/design-is-how-it-works/). To me, it was by far the most focused, engaging, and well executed talk at the conference. This is partially due to Wright's charisma (he seems like a pretty funny guy), but he also kept his presentation focused, nicely wove in anecdotes, and provided lots of good examples to present his case. He clearly articulated the importance of design-based thinking in news and I think made a good case for an [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) work environment. It probably also helped that his [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/davewrightjr/design-ishowitworks) looked good too.

####One critique

From a developer perspective, I was bit underwhelmed with the conference's offerings for data-journalists. This was more apparent in retrospect, but I think the conference is designed to have many high-level offerings for a broad audience, and in many cases made to introduce journalists to certain technologies. This can be seen in the pre-conference workshops, like [Intro to Practical Programming](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/introduction-to-practical-programming/) and [Intro to Data Viz](http://ona12.journalists.org/sessions/intro-to-data-viz/) and in some of the sessions. 

One instance of this was [Amy Webb](https://twitter.com/webbmedia)'s popular annual [10 tech trends](http://webbmediagroup.com/blog/webbmedia-groups-secret-sauce) session. While it's billed as a forecast, it seemed more like a recap (I didn't actually attend the session, but I [followed](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%2310techtrends) it on Twitter and read a few summaries). For example, [trend number 4](http://gannettona2012.tumblr.com/post/32002584226/top-tech-trends) was Responsive Design. The [book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) on responsive design was published in June of 2011. The first major use of responsive design in journalism was [The Boston Globe](http://bostonglobe.com/) [relaunch](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/features/) in [September 2011](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/09/four-observations-and-lots-of-questions-on-the-boston-globes-lovely-new-paywalled-site/). [Several](http://www.propublica.org) [other](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/) [news](http://m.washingtonpost.com) [organizations](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news) have since published and are actively creating responsive sites and news applications. I feel like some of the other trends on the list (verification, video, and directed advertising in particular) are not really trends, but are all commonly used within and outside of online journalism.

####In the end

Thanks again to the Center for Public Interest Journalism for sending me as well as 25 other Philadelphia journalists. I had a great time and found the conference very inspiring. It was also great to meet so many new journalists (mostly from Philly, ironically). For next year, I'm really looking forward to the NICAR [conference](http://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/315/); which should be another immersive experience that is a bit more applicable to what I do and what I want to learn.
