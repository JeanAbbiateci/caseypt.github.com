Today the Online News association <a href="http://journalists.org/2013/09/16/2013-online-journalism-awards-finalists-announced/">announced</a> the finalists for the 2013 ONA awards and AxisPhilly is a finalist in three categories! I'm most proud that the <a href="http://apps.axisphilly.org/avi-map">AVI Map</a> is a finalist, along with FactCheck.org's <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/10/factchecking-the-hofstra-debate/">coverage</a> of the 2012 presidential debates and <a href="http://www.iranelectionwatch.com/">Iran Election Watch</a>, in the "Planned News/Event, Small" category.

AxisPhilly is also a finalist in "Explanatory Reporting, Small", for our coverage of <a href="http://axisphilly.org/project/taxes/">the switch</a> to the Actual Value Initiative, and in "General Excellence in Online Journalism, Small."

Congratulations to all other finalists. I won't be able to make it to the conference this year but I'll be following the award ceremony from home.
