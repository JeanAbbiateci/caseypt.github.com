I'm Casey Thomas, a web developer and GIS analyst based out of Philadelphia. I write about coding, mapping and data. At the moment, I help journalists tell stories on the internet for the <a href="http://www.ppiin.org">Philadelphia Public Interest Information Network</a>; a new journalism organization.
