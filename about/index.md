I'm Casey Thomas, a freelance web developer and GIS analyst based out of Philadelphia. I write about code, maps, data, journalism, and technology. At the moment, I help journalists tell stories on the internet for the <a href="http://www.ppiin.org">Philadelphia Public Interest Information Network</a>.
